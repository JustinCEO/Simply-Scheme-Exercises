# Simply Scheme Exercises

Github for the learning project that I write about at my [blog](http://justinmallone.com/simply-scheme/)

Some of the exercise-related files might not make sense on their own without the context of the relevant blog post for the chapter.

I used a Scheme definitions file `simply_redef.scm` for several earlier chapters and that file is reflected in my Github chapter folders. I eventually switched to using `#lang planet dyoo/simply-scheme:2:2` at the top of the DrRacket definitions window because that seemed to produce more reliable results in terms of successfully running programs.
